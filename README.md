**Welcome to Foamify** â€” an interactive, randomized foam generator designed for scientific modeling and visualization. Foamify creates coordinate files specifying the locations and radii of a randomly generated ensemble of spheres, allowing users to produce custom foams for a wide range of applications. These virtual foams can be used to simulate and analyze physics-based systems such as aerated media, porous materials, and other complex microstructures. Sphere generation is governed by a flexible set of user-defined parameters (see [Parameters](Parameters), offering full control over the statistical and geometric characteristics of the output.

# Overview

Foamify is a lightweight and flexible Python package for generating randomized sphere ensembles with tunable geometric properties. It was developed to support modeling of disordered systems such as foams, aerated media, and porous materials, and is suited for integration into simulation pipelines or exploratory analysis tools.

The generator provides control over key structural parameters, including:

- Density
- Mean radius
- Polydispersity
- Number of spheres
- Overlap percentage
- Distribution type
- Periodicity

Foamify outputs simple coordinate and radius data in plain-text format, compatible with visualization and analysis tools. This includes native support for PyMOL, as well as seamless interoperability with Vorpy, a Voronoi-based geometry analysis tool developed in the same lab.

The project was created in collaboration with the Chemistry Department at Georgia State University and is published on PyPI for easy installation and use within existing Python codebases. For usage examples and API documentation, see the [Usage](Usage) section.
